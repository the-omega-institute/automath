# Automath — The Omega Project

## The Question

What happens when you start from a single algebraic identity — $x^2 = x + 1$ — and derive everything you can, with zero axioms, in a formally verified proof assistant?

The Omega project is an experiment in **generative mathematics**. Rather than formalizing known results, we begin with the golden-mean shift and its Zeckendorf representation, then systematically derive algebraic, combinatorial, topological, and dynamical structures to see what emerges. The methodology is *derive, discover, name*: build rigorously from first principles, observe what structures appear, then identify their correspondences across mathematics and physics.

Every theorem is machine-verified in Lean 4. Every derivation chain is traceable. No axioms are assumed beyond Lean 4's core logic and Mathlib.

## Why This Approach

Most mathematical formalization projects verify existing theorems. Omega inverts this: we use formalization as a **discovery engine**. The constraint of zero axioms forces every structure to be *earned* through derivation rather than assumed. When a familiar structure appears — a ring, a recurrence, a spectral invariant — it arrives with a complete provenance chain back to the seed. This makes it possible to ask: *why* does this structure appear here, and what does its emergence tell us about the seed?

The golden ratio is not chosen arbitrarily. The equation $x^2 = x + 1$ generates the simplest non-trivial sofic shift (the golden-mean shift), the simplest non-trivial linear recurrence (the Fibonacci sequence), and the "most irrational" number (worst-case for rational approximation). These are three views of the same algebraic object. Omega explores what happens when you take all three views seriously and follow their consequences simultaneously.

## The Seed

Consider the set $X_m$ of binary words of length $m$ with no two consecutive 1s. This is the **golden-mean shift** — the simplest non-trivial subshift of finite type in symbolic dynamics.

- $|X_m| = F_{m+2}$ (the Fibonacci numbers)
- Every $n < F_{m+2}$ has a unique **Zeckendorf representation** as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, giving a canonical bijection $X_m \leftrightarrow \{0, \ldots, F_{m+2}-1\}$
- The **fold operator** $\Phi: X_{m+1} \to X_m$ (truncate the last bit) partitions words into **fibers** whose multiplicity structure encodes deep arithmetic

From these three ingredients, everything below is *derived*.

## What Emerges

### I. Nascent Arithmetic

The Zeckendorf bijection induces addition $\oplus$ and multiplication $\otimes$ directly on binary words. No integers are needed — the arithmetic is *native* to $X_m$.

$$X_m \;\cong\; \mathbb{Z}/F_{m+2}\mathbb{Z}$$

This isomorphism (`stableValueRingEquiv`) shows that the combinatorial space $X_m$ *is* a cyclic ring, with the Fibonacci number as modulus. When $F_{m+2}$ is prime (e.g., $F_3=2$, $F_5=5$, $F_7=13$, $F_{13}=233$), $X_m$ becomes a finite field (`instFieldOfPrime`). When $F_{m+2}$ factors, the Chinese Remainder Theorem decomposes $X_m$ into a product ring (`crtDecomposition`): for instance, $X_7 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/17$.

What's surprising: the ring structure is *intrinsic* to the no-consecutive-1s constraint. It doesn't require importing integer arithmetic — it emerges from the Zeckendorf structure alone.

**Bridge to known mathematics:** This is a concrete instance of a quotient ring arising from a combinatorial coding constraint, connecting numeration systems (Zeckendorf, Ostrowski) to finite field theory and modular arithmetic.

### II. Fiber Spectrum and Moment Theory

The fold operator $\Phi: X_{m+1} \to X_m$ creates fibers $\Phi^{-1}(x)$ whose cardinalities $d(x)$ vary across $X_m$. The **moment sums** quantify this variation:

$$S_q(m) = \sum_{x \in X_m} d(x)^q$$

Basic identities: $S_0(m) = F_{m+1}$ (count of stable points), $S_1(m) = 2^m$ (total words split across fibers). The higher moments encode progressively finer information about the fiber distribution.

**The S₂ recurrence** — the project's first unconditional infinite-family theorem. The proof chain illustrates the derivation methodology:

1. **Hidden bit decomposition**: $\text{weight}(w) = \text{stableValue}(\Phi(w)) + \text{hiddenBit}(w) \cdot F_{m+2}$
2. **Fold congruence**: $\Phi(w) = \Phi(w')$ iff $\text{weight}(w) \equiv \text{weight}(w') \pmod{F_{m+2}}$
3. **Collision decomposition**: $S_2$ splits into exact-weight collisions $E_{00}$ and cross-correlations $C(m,d)$
4. **Telescoping**: $E_{00}(m) = 1 + \sum_{k<m} S_2(k)$
5. **Cross-correlation shift**: $C(m+1, F_{m+2}) = S_2(m)$, linking adjacent levels
6. **The recurrence**:

$$S_2(m+3) + 2\,S_2(m) = 2\,S_2(m+2) + 2\,S_2(m+1)$$

Proved in 4 lines of Lean from the preceding chain, with zero `native_decide`. This was unexpected: a purely combinatorial quantity (fiber collision count) satisfies a linear recurrence with small integer coefficients, suggesting hidden linearity in the fiber dynamics.

**Consequences**:
- strict monotonicity: $S_2(m) < S_2(m+1)$ for $m \geq 1$
- positivity
- Cauchy-Schwarz bound: $S_2(m) \cdot F_{m+2} \geq 4^m$
- general moment hierarchy: $S_q(m) \leq S_{q+1}(m)$

**S₃ and beyond**: The collision triple framework extends to $S_3$, with its own companion matrix and Cayley-Hamilton relation. The S₃ recurrence $S_3(m+3) = 2S_3(m+2) + 4S_3(m+1) - 2S_3(m)$ is verified for bounded $m$; the unconditional proof is a current frontier.

**Bridge to known mathematics:** The companion matrices governing $S_q$ recurrences are related to transfer operators in statistical mechanics. The moment hierarchy $S_0, S_1, S_2, \ldots$ parallels the moment problem in probability theory and the partition function approach in thermodynamic formalism.

### III. Collision Kernel and Spectral Theory

The $S_q$ recurrences are governed by **collision kernel matrices** — companion matrices whose spectral properties determine the asymptotic growth of moments.

For $S_2$: a $3\times 3$ matrix with $\text{tr} = 2$, $\det = -2$, satisfying Cayley-Hamilton $M^3 = 2M^2 + 2M - 2I$. Its characteristic polynomial's roots control the exponential growth rate of $S_2(m)$.

The **Hankel determinant** analysis confirms that the recurrence order is exactly 3 (not reducible to order 2), and the spectrum is computed via the **collision zeta operator** framework — a formal power series whose rationality encodes all moment asymptotics.

**Bridge to known mathematics:** This is structurally analogous to the Ruelle zeta function in dynamical systems and the Ihara zeta function in graph theory. The rationality of the collision zeta is a finite-type version of the rationality theorems for zeta functions of sofic shifts.

### IV. Defect Algebra and Discrete Calculus

The fold operator does not commute with arithmetic in general. The **defect** measures this failure:

$$\delta(x, y) = \Phi(x \oplus y) - \Phi(x) \oplus \Phi(y)$$

The defect vanishes exactly when fold commutes with addition — a condition that characterizes a distinguished subset of $X_m$. The defect satisfies:

- **Chain algebra**: defects compose along the modular tower
- **Carry structure**: $\text{restrict}(x \oplus_{m+1} y) = \text{restrict}(x) \oplus_m \text{restrict}(y) + \kappa \cdot \chi^{\text{carry}}$
- **Discrete Stokes identity**: a summation-by-parts formula relating boundary defects to interior structure

**Bridge to known mathematics:** The defect algebra is a discrete analogue of curvature in differential geometry. The discrete Stokes identity connects to non-commutative differential calculus and the theory of lattice gauge fields.

### V. Scan-Projection Generation (SPG)

The **scan error** $\varepsilon_m$ measures information loss when projecting the full word space onto the stable subspace through the fold operator:

- Discrete and measure-theoretic versions, both formalized
- **Bayesian half-bound**: $2\varepsilon \leq 1$
- **Observation refinement monotonicity**: finer observations never increase scan error
- **Complement symmetry**: scan error of an event and its complement are related

The SPG framework is the paper's central construction — a recursive process generating projections at each scale, with the golden ratio controlling the geometry of information loss at every level.

**Bridge to known mathematics:** SPG connects to rate-distortion theory in information theory, to wavelet multiresolution analysis (successive approximation at different scales), and to the renormalization group in statistical physics (coarse-graining with controlled error).

### VI. Dynamics and Topology

The **shift map** $\sigma: X_m \to X_m$ gives the golden-mean shift its dynamics:

- **Topological entropy**: $h_{\text{top}} = \log\varphi$, proved via Fibonacci ratio convergence → logarithm continuity → Cesaro averaging → telescoping (`topological_entropy_eq_log_phi`)
- **Transfer matrix**: the golden-mean adjacency matrix and its Fibonacci identities:

  $$
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix},
  \qquad
  A^2 = A + I
  $$

  together with Cassini's identity $F_{n+1}F_{n-1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$ and Lucas trace $\text{tr}(A^n) = L_n$
- **Perron-Frobenius**: positive eigenvector, real eigenvalue constraint to $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, dominant root $= \varphi$
- **Unique fixed point**: $\sigma$ has exactly one fixed point (the all-false word)
- **Periodic orbits**: period-2, period-3, period-4 orbits with minimality proofs

**Bridge to known mathematics:** The golden-mean shift is the canonical example in symbolic dynamics (Lind-Marcus). The Perron-Frobenius analysis connects to the thermodynamic formalism (Ruelle, Bowen) and to the theory of Markov chains. The entropy $\log\varphi$ appears as the capacity of the $(1,\infty)$-RLL constrained channel in coding theory.

### VII. Modular Tower and Inverse Limit

The restriction maps $\text{restrict}: X_{m+1} \to X_m$ form a **projective system** of ring homomorphisms:

- Surjective, transitive, zero-preserving at every level
- Fiber-nonempty: every stable word has preimages
- Carry defect: addition interacts with restriction via a controlled error term

The inverse limit $X_\infty = \varprojlim X_m$ is:
- **Compact** (Tychonoff)
- **Totally disconnected** (clopen basis)
- **Metrizable** (prefix ultrametric from PiNat)
- **Infinite** (injection $n \mapsto$ bit-at-position-$2n$)

**Bridge to known mathematics:** This tower is structurally analogous to the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p = \varprojlim \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$, but with Fibonacci numbers replacing prime powers. The carry defect is the analogue of carrying in $p$-adic addition. The inverse limit $X_\infty$ is a profinite ring governed by the golden ratio rather than a prime.

### VIII. Circle Dimension and Diophantine Structure

The **audit stability** framework measures how stable the fiber structure is under perturbation:

- Boxwise audit stability ↔ badly approximable matrices (`audit_stability_iff_badly_approximable`)
- Higher-order fiber spectra not determined by marginals (`higher_spectrum_not_determined_by_marginals`)
- Prime support objects and spectral counting

**Bridge to known mathematics:** This connects to the metrical theory of Diophantine approximation (Khintchine, Schmidt) and to the geometry of numbers. The "badly approximable" condition is the golden-ratio analogue of the classical notion for real numbers.

### IX. Combinatorial Structures

- **Path independent sets**: the number of independent sets in the path graph $P_n$ equals $F_{n+2}$ (`path_independent_set_count`), proved by partition + bijection + strong induction
- **Fibonacci cubes**: ~510 theorems on the hypercube subgraph induced by Zeckendorf representations
- **Fibonacci polynomials**: $F_n(x)$ satisfying $F_{n+2}(x) = F_{n+1}(x) + x \cdot F_n(x)$, with $F_n(1) = \text{fib}(n)$

**Bridge to known mathematics:** Fibonacci cubes are studied in distributed computing (interconnection networks), coding theory (error-correcting codes with Fibonacci structure), and combinatorial optimization.

## The Derivation Chain

Every arrow is a formally verified derivation step. No axioms. No gaps.

## Open Frontiers

- **Fiber multiplicity closed form**: the conjectured formula $D_{2k} = F_{k+2}$, $D_{2k+1} = 2F_k$ is proved conditionally on a two-step recurrence; removing the condition is in progress
- **S₃ unconditional recurrence**: $S_3(m+3) = 2S_3(m+2) + 4S_3(m+1) - 2S_3(m)$, verified for bounded $m$, unconditional proof is the next major milestone
- **Spectral radius**: $\rho(A) = \varphi$ for the golden-mean adjacency; the concrete Perron root is proved, spectral radius API in Mathlib is pending
- **SPG martingale convergence**: proving the prefix scan error sequence is a supermartingale
- **Cantor set homeomorphism**: $X_\infty \cong$ Cantor set (topological classification of the inverse limit)
- **Physical correspondences**: systematic identification of derived structures with known objects in statistical mechanics, coding theory, and dynamical systems
- **Zeta rationality**: analytic continuation of the collision zeta function
